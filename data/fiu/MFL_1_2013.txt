The hearing took place on 28th February, 2012 at 3.00 PM and was attended by Shri K.R. Bijimon, Chief General Manager, authorized by the noticee dlongwith Shri f{akesh MollI"I:1,AGM and Shri P.I<.Gopan, SFM. 8. D,unng hearing on 28 February, 2012, Muthoot filed written submission admitting the failure to file Cash Transaction Reports (CTRs), and requested for condonation of the mistake, stating it to be unintentional and inadvertent. They further stated that tile information on CTRs was being received by tlleir Head Office from tile branches but was not being filed with FIU-IND due to ~rsonal failure oLtbe ~rincipal Officer and that CTRs were beinq filed in respect of other two flQllfl..pf the Group, namelv, Muthoot Vehicle and Asset Finance Limited and MUUlOotExcOj~lliliL.QOrnpanv PvC Ltd. It was submitted that after receipt of the notice from FIU-IND in June, 2011, the CTRs were being filed regularly from July, 2011 onwards Mulhoot admitted that their internal reviE~wsystem failed to deh~ct non.. filing of cn~s, and submitted a copy of their letter dated 13thJuly, 2011, whereby CTRs had be(jn filed for the period from April 2004 to June, 2011. I 9. It was pointed out to Muthoot during the hearing on 28th February 2012 that as per information given by Muthoot on 5th Jan., 2011, 2697 Cash transactions in excess of RS.10 lakh had taken place between 1.4.2006 and 30.11.2010 (which was the basis for the show-cause notice dated 13.06.2011J Annexure..olQ of the notice), but as pef their letter dated 13th July, 2011, there appeared to be 8,494 cash transactions in excess of RS.10 lakh during the same period. Muthoot explained that the information submitted on 5th January, 2011 did not incorporate integrally connected transactions adding up to in excess of RS.10 lakh, as Muthoot were not aware of the reporting requirement for integrally connected cash transactions, whereas the information furnished vide their letter dated 131t: July, 2011 included all transactions, including integrally connected Order- in-Original No:l! Dirl FIU-IND/2013 I r Order- in-Original No.11 Dirl FIU-IND/2013 5 transactions. Accordingly,the actual number of instances of failure works out to be §.l~1~1. Muthoot requested for a time of 15 days for filing further written submissions, which was allowed. 10. Subsequent to the hearing on 28thFebruary 2012 on Muthoot's request received on 12.03.2012, their Managing DirectorMr.George Alexander Muthoot was allowed to personally file written submissions on 23rd March, 2012. The submission, inessence, stated the followingpoints: (a) Pfv'lLAbeing a new legislation. it took some time for Muthoot to put in placethE!requiredsystems. (b) The fact of non-compliance was admitted, stating further that reports were being filed regularly from March 2011 onwards. (c) There was no intention of non-compliance. (d) Due to lack of understanding regarding the type of transactions to be reported, the integrally connected transactions meeting the stipulated threshold of RS.10 lakh duringthe period1.4.2006to 30.11.2010 were not reported but the position was rectifiedin later submissions. Propo~e.Q.~!LQ'!! 11. Having considered the issues raised in the show-cause notice dated 13th June. ;~01'1 and the replies in defense by Muthoot in written submissions as well as durinn personal hearing, the matter to be decided was: (ii) Whetller Muthoot failed to corflply with Section 12 of tile Act requiring furnishing of prescribed information to Director, FIU-IND and, if so. the quantum of fine to be levied under Section 13 of the Act for each failure to comply with obligations as per Section 12 of the Act. As regards the first issue the failure had been established by the inquiry in FIU-IND and also admitted by Muthoot in their submissions. So tar as the Order- in-Original NO.1i Dirl FIU-IND/20'13 Order- in-Original No.1t Dirt FIU-INDt2013 6 second issue is concerned, Section 13 of the Act prescribes the amount of fine to be Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 1 lakh for each failure. Considering the facts & circumstances of the case and the various submissions made by Muthoot during personal 'learing and in written submissions, it was proposed to impose the rnininwm prescribed fine under Sec.13 of the Act viz, Rs 10,000/- for each failure. The total fine thus comes to RS.2,69,70,000/- (Rupees Two er-ore Sixty Nine lakh, Seventy thousand only) for 2,697 cash transactions. A draft copy of the order proposing the fine was sent to Muthoot on 23.11.2012 giving 15 days time to submit written submissions, if any, on the proposed order. 12. Muthoot submitted their written submissions dated 24th November, 2012, broadly reiterating their earlier position that the non-compliance occurred because PMLA was a relatively new legislation and there was lack of proper understanding regarding the type of transactions required to be reported. Statin~Jthat they had no intention to defy the law and deliberately act in its breach, Muthoot pl~~adedfor not imposing the fine. Muthoot also raised certain legal questions including inter alia that: (i) there was absence of principles governing the levy of a fine or penalty such as intent, any blatant disregard of law, wanton negligenc(~ or lack of due diligence and reasonable cause; (ii) rult! of limitation applies as proceedings had been taken up beyond reasonable time; (iji) quantum of penalty @ Rs.'I0,000/- for each transaction was unreasonable, as Section 13 of the Act refers to fine 'for each failure' which should be related to Muthoot's obligation to file monthly eTR returns; in the absence of available precedence u/s. 13(2) of the Act for determining the quantum of fine, the general law regarding penalties, I (iv) Order. in-Original No.1/ Dirt FIU-IND/2013 '. r- Order- in-OriginalNo.1/ Dir/ FIU-IND/2013 7 as applied in fiscal and economic legislation such as the IT Act, the SEBI Act and RBI Act and other allied legislations as pronounced by the Apex Court and other judicial authority should be followed; (v) in view of proposed amendments in the Act, fine should be imposed as a last resort after exhausting remedies being provided therein.

Muthoot reiterated the points made in the above mentioned written submissions dated 24.11.2012, again in a personal hearing on 17."12.2012, granted on tl1E~irequest, and attended by Mr. Abhijit Roy of M/s.

Mr. Ray also handed over a write-up containing point-wise summary of submissions made on 24.11.20'12. Findin~s &DisclIssion 14. I .have gone through the facts and circumstances of the case and Muthoot's reply dated 7.07.2011 to the show cause notice, written submissions made during personal hearing on 28.02.2012, written submissions dated 23- 03.20'12 filed by Mr. George Alexander Muthoot, and further written subrnissions dated 24. '11.2012. 15. After considering all aspects of the case the following position emerges: I · By its own admission, Muthoot has failed to comply with its obligations to file CTRs under Section 12 of the PMLA and Rules made thereunder. Ignorance of law, lack of resources and negligence of employees etc., as cited by Muthoot, are not valid reasons for non-compliance. · PIV1L/\ and lhe F\ules made thereunder have prescribed time limit fOI reporting transactions i.e. Cash Transaction Reports (CTRs), Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs) and Counterfeit Currency Reports (CCRs). Timely submission of reports is crucial for effectively combating money laundering, terrorist financing, tax evasion, security threats and other ~Fave crimes. As time is of essence in such cases, late submission of n~polts is also a violation of law as much as the non-submission. · While it is a fact that the Rules p,escribe submission of CTRs monthly, the primary obligation is to furnish the report (CTR) in respect of each transaction that falls within the purview of Section of 12 of the PMLA read with Rule 8 of the Rules. Thus, the "failure" in terms of Section 13 of the PMLA relates to failure to file a report in respect of each transaction, and not the failure to file one monthly CTR. Order- in-Original No.1t Dirt FIU-INDt2013 . -. ... Order- in-Original No.1/ Dir/ FIU-IND/2013 to The culpability of Muthoot is evident in view of Muthoot's admission that CTRs were being filed for other group companies and the fact that the CTRs in respect of the noticee company viz., Muthoot Finance Ltd. were filed only after the failure was pointed out by FIU-IND. · Muthoot never voluntarily filed the reports, before the failures were poin.ted out by the FIU-lt,JO. · The argument of the Muthoot that the use of term 'may' and not "shall" with regard to the Director, FIU-IND's authority to levy a fine under section '13(2) of PMLA indicates that it is not mandatory, is not acceptable. The word 'may' is capable of meaning 'must' or 'shall' in light of the context, where discretion is conferred upon a public authority, coupled with an obligation, the word 'may' denoting discretion should be construed to mean cornmand. (AIR 1963 se 1618 Textile Commission vs. SagaI' Textile Mills, AIR 1977 se '1516,1517). · Muthoot's argument that fine can be imposed under Section 13 (2) (d) as a last resort after exhausting other available persuasive remedies proposed in clauses (a) to (c) of the amended section 13(2) of PMLA, is not acceptal:>lea~ tile lion-compliance and lIle associated sanctions have to be adjudicated under the law in force at the time of adjudication. .. Muthoot's plea that the proceedings are barred by limitation is not tenable as the PMLA does not stipulate a time-limit for initiation of proceedings for ncm.compiiance. On the other hand, sufficient time and opportunity has b(:!en Ylven to Muthoot at every stage of the adjudication proceedings to present its defense in accordance with the principles of natural justice. ~ · The case laws cited by Muthoot are not applicable or germane to the current case, as this adjudication is being made after full consideration given to the facts and circumstances of the case, after following the principles of natural justice and giving full opportunity to Muthoot (the notice) to present its defense. Order.. in-Original NO.1/ Oir/ FIU-IND/2013 -.... Order- in-Original NO.1t Dirt FIU-INDt2013 10 '16. Considering all the points mentioned above, I determine that Muthoot has failed to comply with Section 12 of the PMLA and the Rules made thereunder by not filing CTRs in respect of 2,697 cash transactions mentioned in the show cause notice dated 13.6.2011 that took place over the penod '1 )\pril, 2000 to 30 November, 2010. "Iowever, considering the fact that some part of this period falls in the early stage of the implementationof the Act and the fact that the faiure has been admitted, I take a lenient view and inlpose the minimumprescribed fine under Section 13 of the PMLAviz., Ps, 10,000 tor each failure. The total amount of fine for not filingCTRs in respect of 2697 casll transactions comes to Rs.2,69,70,OOO Accordingly,In exerCise ot the powers conferred ()n rm~ under Section 13 of the PMLA, I impose on Muthoot a fine of Rs. 2,69,70,000 (Rupees two crore sixty nine la 1<1-1 cHicl sE:verllY thousand).
