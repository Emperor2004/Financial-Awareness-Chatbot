The website had videotaped the conversations with the officials/employees of the banks that were played out in the media suggesting widespread violations of statutory obligations under the PMLA. On 6th May, 2013, Cobra post released recording of the conversation with the Branch Managers of Canara Bank's Okhla, Kalkaji & Vasant Vihar, Delhi branches and / , ~~~ " .-;r,~ nExec utive at Circle office, Agra Branch of Canara Bank.

Section 12 of the Act lays down the general obligations of the banks to file suspicious transaction reports. PML Rules further elaborate these obligations. The definition of suspicious transactions in Rule 2 includes an attempted transaction. "Attempted transaction" has not been defined separately. Rule ~ .~~<:I7r~, 7(3) requires that all reporting entities shall evolve an internal mechanism ~ \t.LLlG~ ~ ~ t OO ~. ~~~ aving regard to any guidelines issued by the Regulator for detecting the 1< ~ ~':. ~* \ ~ --~ V'~ \~ if / 4 of 6, Order No.22/DIR/FIU-IND/2015 ,~ "J:./I'<':.: transactions referred to in Rule 3 and for furnishing information about such transactions in such form as may be directed by its Regulator. 12. A perusal of the transcript of the Cobrapost sting operation shows that the Cobra post reporter posing as a customer visited 3 branches of the Bank at Kalkaji - Okhla, Delhi; Vasant Vihar, Delhi and Circle Office, Agra and told the managers that he wanted to invest on behalf of a minister large amount of cash ranging from 50 lakh to 80 lakh of unexplained origin which he wanted to be converted into white. He also suggested that Rs. 5-7 crore more was expected from a deal in Greater Noida. The bankers suggested to invest the cash by opening multiple accounts and investing slowly and gradually in insurance, fixed deposits, gold and mutual funds. The bankers discussed different methods for conversion of black money into white e.g. by routing it through third parties like Chartered Accountants. One banker also quotes the rate of the fees for converting black into white. The bankers also agreed upon allotting lockers for keeping the cash; and suggested cash to be deposited into saving accounts as there will be no problem in it regarding TD5. On the question of remitting money outside India for use by the minister's wife, the banker assured the Cobrapost reporter that it would be easily done and also assured that the whole deal will be kept secret. The phone numbers are also exchanged. I 13.The conversations between the Cobra post reporter and the Bank Manager ha.dseveral features which should have led to generation of behavi~ural alerts as per IBA guidelines as well as the policies and instructions issued by the Bank (policy for 2012-13 was approved by the board of the Bank vide orders dated 03-12-2012). However, despite ample indications that the funds being discussed were of suspicious nature, no alerts were generated by the branch officials. On the contrary, the coptent, tone and tenor of the conversations/ discussions with the Cobra post reporter were conspiratorial and do not indicate any sense of alarm, which a prudent banker, entrusted with the legal responsibility of reporting suspicious transactions and combating money laundering or financing of terrorism, would be expected to display in such circumstances. The matter was. not even reported to the Principal Officer of the Bank. The Bank will not be able to fulfil its reporting obligations under the ~'~'C{'1r~ PMLA unless there is a free flow of information from its branches to the ''It ..\E~LlG~1-;~Principal Officer (MLRO), who is responsible to fulfil the reporting obligations. ( 4!?Y .. c; , ~ :::;* * ..., . J 5 of 6, Order No.22/DIR/FIU-IND/2015 " I IN';)\\>- ,,- ~ -- Evidently, the Bank Managers were either oblivious of their duties or cared little for compliance with their legal obligations under the PMLA. PMLA aims at prevention of laundering of the proceeds of crime. That even attempted transactions are required to be reported points to the high level of expectation the law has from the banks. It is not enough for the Bank to lay down a policy; it is equally important to ensure its implementation. 14.ln light of the above, I conclude that in Canara Bank's Kalkaji - Okhla, Delhi; Vasant Vihar, Delhi and Circle Office, Agra branches reported by Cobrapost, there was a failure in the Canara Bank's internal mechanism for detecting and reporting attempted suspicious transactions, in terms of Section 12 of PMLA read with Rules 2, 3, 5 and 7 of the PML Rules. Accordingly, in exercise of the powers conferred on me under Section 13 (2) of the PMLA, 2002, I hereby impose on Canara Bank a fine of Rs. 3,00,000 (Rupees three Lakh) for three instances of failure in its Kalkaji - Okhla, Delhi; Vasant Vihar, Delhi and Circle Office, Agra branches to comply with its obligations as laid down in Section 12 of the PMLA read with Rules 2, 3, 5 and 7 of the PML Rules framed thereunder.
