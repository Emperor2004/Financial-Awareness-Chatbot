      "question": "What is PMLA?",
      "generated_answer": " The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, is a legislative measure enacted by the Parliament of India to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism. It came into force on July 1, 2005.\n\n1. **Core definition and purpose**: The PMLA defines money laundering as the process of converting illicit funds derived from criminal activities into ostensibly legitimate assets. Its primary objective is to detect, prevent, and penalize such activities.\n\n2. **Key operational mechanisms**:\n   - **Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs)**: Financial institutions are required to submit STRs when they suspect that a transaction may be related to money laundering or terrorism financing.\n   - **Cash Transaction Reports (CTRs)**: CTRs must be filed for cash transactions exceeding ₹10 lakhs. This helps in tracking large cash transactions and identifying potential money laundering activities.\n   - **Know Your Customer (KYC)**: Financial institutions are mandated to verify the identity of their customers, understand the purpose and intended nature of business relationships, and conduct ongoing monitoring to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering regulations.\n   - **Cross-Border Wire Transfer Reports (CBWTR)**: When a financial institution sends or receives an international wire transfer exceeding ₹5 lakhs, it must file a CBWTR. This helps in identifying and tracking cross-border money laundering activities.\n\n3. **Compliance requirements and procedures**: Financial institutions are expected to implement robust anti-money laundering (AML) programs, including customer due diligence measures, ongoing monitoring, and regular training for staff. Non-compliance can lead to penalties, including fines and imprisonment.\n\n4. **Consequences/penalties**: Violations of the PMLA can result in severe penalties, including imprisonment for up to seven years and fines. In addition, the Act empowers the Financial Intelligence Unit-India (FIU-IND) to investigate money laundering cases and issue show-cause notices, attach assets, and prosecute offenders.\n\nThis is informational guidance only.
