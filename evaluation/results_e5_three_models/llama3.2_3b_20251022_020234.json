      "generated_answer": "**The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, is an Act of Parliament that came into force on July 1, 2005, with the primary objective of preventing and combating money laundering in India.**\n\nThe PMLA defines money laundering as a process or activity connected with proceeds of crime, which includes concealment, possession, acquisition, use, projecting as untainted property, or claiming it as untainted property in any manner whatsoever. A person shall be guilty of an offence of money laundering if they are found to have directly or indirectly attempted to indulge or knowingly assisted or knowingly is a party or is actually involved in one or more of these processes or activities.\n\n**Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs) and Cash Transaction Reports (CTRs)** play a crucial role in identifying and reporting transactions that may be indicative of money laundering. CTRs for cash transactions exceeding ₹10 lakhs must be filed with the Financial Intelligence Unit-India (FIU-IND). Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures are also essential in preventing money laundering, as they help to verify the identity of customers and ensure that transactions are conducted in a legitimate manner.\n\n**Compliance with PMLA requirements is mandatory for all financial institutions and individuals involved in financial transactions. Failure to comply can result in severe penalties, including fines and imprisonment.**\n\nThis is informational guidance only.

      "reference_answer": "Yes, a person can be prosecuted for money laundering even if they didn't know the money was from illegal sources, provided they knowingly assisted or were a party to the processes of concealment, possession, acquisition, use, projecting as untainted property, or claiming as untainted property. The key requirement is 'knowingly' assisting in these processes, not necessarily knowing the original source of the funds.",
