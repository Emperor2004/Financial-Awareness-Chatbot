It came into force on July 1, 2005, and aims to prevent, detect, investigate, and prosecute offenses related to money laundering.\n\nThe PMLA establishes a framework for reporting entities, including banks, financial institutions, and designated professionals, to identify and report suspicious transactions.

They must establish internal policies and procedures for compliance with the Act's provisions. The FIU-IND analyzes the reported information and shares it with relevant law enforcement agencies for further investigation and prosecution. \n\nFailure to comply with the PMLA can result in severe penalties, including imprisonment and fines.  The Act also empowers authorities to freeze assets suspected of being involved in money laundering activities.\n\n\nThis is informational guidance only.

      "generated_answer": "The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, is an Act of Parliament that came into force on July 1, 2005.  Money laundering refers to the process of disguising illegally obtained funds to make them appear legitimate. Criminal activities such as drug trafficking, arms sales, and cybercrime generate illicit profits. Money laundering aims to conceal the origin of these proceeds, allowing criminals to enjoy their ill-gotten gains without facing legal repercussions.\n\nThe PMLA mandates that financial institutions and designated entities implement robust anti-money laundering (AML) measures. These include filing **Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs)** when they detect transactions that appear suspicious or potentially linked to money laundering activities.  **Cash Transaction Reports (CTRs)** are required for cash transactions exceeding ₹10 lakhs. Additionally, entities must adhere to **Know Your Customer (KYC)** procedures to verify the identity of their customers and understand their financial activities.\n\nFinancial institutions are obligated to establish internal controls, conduct due diligence on customers, monitor transactions for suspicious patterns, and report any suspected money laundering activities to the **Financial Intelligence Unit-India (FIU-IND)**. The FIU-IND analyzes these reports and shares information with relevant law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute money laundering cases.\n\nFailure to comply with the PMLA can result in severe penalties, including fines, imprisonment, and reputational damage.  The Act aims to deter money laundering activities, protect the integrity of the financial system, and safeguard national security.\n\n\nThis is informational guidance only.
