A key operational mechanism under PMLA is the requirement for financial institutions to implement a Client Due Diligence (CDD) programme.\n\n**Key Operational Mechanisms:**\nSuspicious Transaction Reports (STRs) are generated by financial institutions when they suspect any transaction that may be indicative of money laundering or terrorist financing. Cash Transaction Reports (CTRs) for transactions exceeding ₹10 lakhs must also be filed with the Financial Intelligence Unit-India (FIU-IND). Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures are essential to ensure that all customers are verified and their identities confirmed.\n\n**Compliance Requirements:**\nFinancial institutions are required to implement a CDD programme, which involves verifying the identity of their customers, assessing the risk associated with each customer, and maintaining records of these assessments. This programme is crucial in preventing money laundering and terrorist financing.\n\n**Consequences/penalties:**\n Failure to comply with PMLA requirements can result in severe penalties, including fines and imprisonment. Financial institutions that fail to implement a CDD programme or file STRs and CTRs as required may face legal action.\n\nThis is informational guidance only.
